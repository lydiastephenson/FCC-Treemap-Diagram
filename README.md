# Visualize Data with a Treemap Diagram

Objective: Build an app that is functionally similar to this: <https://treemap-diagram.freecodecamp.rocks>.

Final Project: <https://fcc-treemap-diagram--lydia-stephenson.repl.co/>

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

1. My tree map should have a title with a corresponding id="title".
2. My tree map should have a description with a corresponding id="description".
3. My tree map should have rect elements with a corresponding class="tile" that represent the data.
4. There should be at least 2 different fill colors used for the tiles.
5. Each tile should have the properties data-name, data-category, and data-value containing their corresponding name, category, and value.
6. The area of each tile should correspond to the data-value amount: tiles with a larger data-value should have a bigger area.
7. My tree map should have a legend with corresponding id="legend".
8. My legend should have rect elements with a corresponding class="legend-item".
9. The rect elements in the legend should use at least 2 different fill colors.
10. I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding id="tooltip" which displays more information about the area.
11. My tooltip should have a data-value property that corresponds to the data-value of the active area.
